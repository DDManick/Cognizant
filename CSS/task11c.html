1. Open your HTML file in Chrome
Open your .html file in Google Chrome by double-clicking it or dragging it into the browser.

2. Open Chrome DevTools
Right-click anywhere on the page and select Inspect or

Press Ctrl + Shift + I (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + Option + I (Mac).

3. Use Device Toolbar to simulate screen sizes
In DevTools, click the Toggle device toolbar button (icon looks like a phone/tablet) or press Ctrl + Shift + M (Cmd + Shift + M on Mac).

Choose from preset devices like iPhone, iPad, Pixel, or enter custom screen sizes.

Your page will resize accordingly, showing how it looks on different devices.

4. Inspect and edit styles live
In the Elements panel, select any element by clicking it or using the element picker (top-left corner icon).

In the Styles panel on the right, you can:

See all CSS rules applied.

Toggle individual rules on/off by checking/unchecking.

Edit CSS properties live by clicking values and typing new ones.

This helps you quickly test fixes like margin, padding, font size, colors, and layout.

5. Use the Network tab to check CSS loading
Go to the Network tab in DevTools.

Reload the page (F5 or Ctrl+R).

Look for your CSS file(s) in the list.

If itâ€™s loaded correctly, it will show with a status 200.

If not found, it will show 404 or other errors.

This helps you verify if your external CSS file is linked and loading properly.

6. Use the Console tab for JavaScript errors or warnings
Check if there are any script errors that might affect layout or behavior.

Fix errors shown here if needed.

7. Using VS Code Live Server (optional but recommended)
Install the Live Server extension in VS Code.

Right-click your HTML file and select Open with Live Server.

This opens your page on a local server and automatically reloads when you save your code.

Refresh DevTools if needed after changes
