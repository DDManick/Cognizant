1. Use “Inspect Element” to Modify Styles Live
Open Chrome DevTools:

Right-click the element on your webpage → Select Inspect (or press Ctrl+Shift+I / Cmd+Option+I).

Modify CSS:

In the Elements panel, you’ll see the HTML on the left and CSS styles on the right.

Click on any CSS property and change its value live.

Add new CSS rules by clicking on the empty space in the styles pane.

Benefits:

Instantly see how changes affect layout.

Test fixes without editing your source files.

2. Use the Console Tab to View Logs
Add console.log() statements in your JavaScript to debug variable values or flow.

Example:

js
Copy
Edit
console.log('Current user:', user);
console.log('Event coordinates:', coords);
Open Console tab in DevTools (Ctrl+Shift+J / Cmd+Option+J) to see output and error messages.

Use the console to test JS snippets live by typing directly.

3. Add Breakpoints in JavaScript
Open Sources tab in DevTools.

Find your JS file in the left panel.

Click the line number where you want to pause execution to set a breakpoint (blue marker appears).

Reload the page to hit breakpoints when code runs.

Inspect variables in Scope section or hover over variables in code.

Step through the code line-by-line using buttons:

Step Over (F10)

Step Into (F11)

Step Out (Shift+F11)

Bonus: Debugging with VS Code
If you open your project in VS Code, you can debug your JS using the Debugger for Chrome extension:

Install Debugger for Chrome extension.

Create a launch configuration (launch.json) with:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "chrome",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Launch Chrome against localhost",
      "url": "http://localhost:3000",  // change to your URL
      "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}"
    }
  ]
}
Set breakpoints in VS Code like in any IDE.

Start debugging, VS Code will open Chrome and connect debugger.
